# The MO2i accepts two types of commands to retrieve parameters. The L command
# brings one parameter, while the command R brings up to 8. We decided to use
# R because we can bring all info needed with just 2 writings to the device.
# With this strategy, the I/O Intr SCAN mode is used in almost all records. A
# care must be taken: don't use the command R with the same number of
# arguments. Example: if you want to bring 10 parameters, use R to bring 6
# and 4 parameters, but never 5 and 5. This is because the Stream Device will
# never know how to rout the parameter to the correct receiver, as the data
# types are identical for every parameter.
#
# Here we defined 2 groups of commands. In the case where more parameters need
# to be retrieved, rebalance them accordingly.


###### GROUP 1

# sys_status is the first parameter in the group 1 sequence.

# flow_rate is the third parameter in the sequence (group 1).
flow_rate

# alarm_status is the fourth parameter in the sequence (group 1).

###### GROUP 2
