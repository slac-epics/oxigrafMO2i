This module controls the Oxigraf MO2i oxigen sensor.

You can find an example IOC application inside the iocs directory. If you want
to build the example IOC, uncomment the line "BUILD_IOCS = YES" from
configure/CONFIG_SITE. You can also copy the example IOC application to
somewhere else, change the configure/RELEASE file and build it detached from
this module.

Information on the database macros that must be defined are explained in the
MO2i.template file.

Following is a list of the PVs available:
Obs: we are calling all $(DEVICE=$(PRIM):$(LOCA):$(UNIT)) structure as <BASE>,
here, for the sake of simplicity.

<BASE>:ChannelIndex -> This points to one of the 4 channels, starting from
zero, and changes it each 15 seconds.

The next 4 PVs read the percentage of O2 in each channel:
<BASE>:Channel0O2
<BASE>:Channel1O2
<BASE>:Channel2O2
<BASE>:Channel3O2

<BASE>:CO2MeasurePct -> CO2 measurement pct
<BASE>:CellTemp -> Cell temperature in Celsius
<BASE>:SampleFlow -> in ml/min

System status:
<BASE>:NonZeroStandbyStatus -> Read "Zero" / "Non Zero"
<BASE>:LineLockAcquired -> Line lock acquired (system ready): read "Acquired" / "Not Acquired".
<BASE>:LaserEnabled -> Laser enable bit, off until laser temperature stabilized: read "Disabled" / "Enabled". 
<BASE>:UncalibratedWarning -> Uncalibrated warning bit, set if current calibration factors are invalid. Reset with the low point calibration command: read "No Warning" / "Warning!".
<BASE>:TestFaultWarning -> Test fault warning bit, disables laser and inhibits temperature control if
set due to an internal self test error: read "No Warning" / "Warning!".
<BASE>:CellWarmUp -> Cell warm-up status, set while cell warming up to operating temperature: read "Warmed" / "Warming up".
<BASE>:PressureCalibrationMode -> Pressure calibration mode flag, set while pressure calibration is active: read "Inactive" / "Active".
<BASE>:MemoryFailure -> Microcontroller memory checksum failure: read "No failure" / "Failure!".
<BASE>:EepromFailure -> Configuration EEPROM signature failure: read "No failure" / "Failure!".
<BASE>:WatchdogTimeout -> Read "No timeout" / "Timeout!".
<BASE>:InvalidO2Computation -> Invalid O2 computation error: read "Valid" / "Invalid!".
<BASE>:LowReferenceSignal -> Low reference signal level: read "High" / "Low".
<BASE>:CellNullBalance -> Cell null balance failure: read "No failure" / "Failure!".
<BASE>:LaserTempControl -> Laser temperature control failure: read "No failure" / "Failure!".

Alarm status. All PVs return "Off" / "On":
<BASE>:LowO2AlarmA
<BASE>:HighO2AlarmA 
<BASE>:LowO2AlarmB 
<BASE>:HighO2AlarmB
<BASE>:LowCO2AlarmA
<BASE>:HighCO2AlarmA
<BASE>:LowCO2AlarmB
<BASE>:HighCO2AlarmB
<BASE>:LowSupplyVoltAlarm -> Low supply voltage.
<BASE>:LowSampleFlowAlarm
<BASE>:HighSampleFlowAlarm
<BASE>:LowSamplePAlarm -> Low sample cell pressure alarm.
<BASE>:HighSamplePAlarm -> High sample cell pressure alarm.
<BASE>:CriticalSelfTestAlarm -> Critical self test failue.
